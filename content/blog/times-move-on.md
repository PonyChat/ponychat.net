#### Cassy

With a degree of sadness we must announce the discontinuation of three of our 
servers. Rainbowdash, Rarity, and Twilightsparkle. They were our original 
servers and the ones PonyIRC were founded on and which evolved into the 
PonyChat that you know today. Changes within staff have resulted in a strong 
reduction in budget for services. The three aforementioned servers are our most 
expensive and therefore must go.

As a result tonight around midnight there will be a net-split as these servers 
are removed from service. Those connected directly to one of these servers will 
need to choose a new server to connect to from now on.

Applejack, Fluttershy, and Pinkiepie will remain online and will be valid 
choices for direct connection should users wish. Users connecting via a more 
general address such as irc.ponychat.net will automatically be reconnected to 
a valid server after a brief disconnect.

PonyChat remains committed to bringing you the best pony and mlp themed IRC 
available anywhere, with the most professional and friendly staff. We see these 
events as needed to ensure this level of quality can continue. Do not worry as 
the remaining servers are more than enough to handle our users for the 
foreseeable future.

As a side issue these changes have resulted in the loss of our IRIS web-chat 
feature. We hope to have this resolved soon if possible.

From all of the staff we thank you for making PonyChat possible, for being 
awesome users, and for continuing to trust in us!
