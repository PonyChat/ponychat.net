This month marks the third anniversary of PonyChat. Three years ago two small 
groups of fans decided that it was time for a dedicated network for My Little 
Pony to be built that catered to fans of all kinds. In the beginning, both 
groups independently and without knowledge of the other started working on 
building the best network they could, and when they finally learned of each 
other it was decided that it would be in everyoneâ€™s best interest to merge, so 
that fans of MLP would not be split between networks.

Those networks called BronyChat and PonyIRC thus fused to become PonyChat. 
Meshing together the best of talents and dedication to the fan base a strong 
foundation was formed, a foundation which has overcome many obstacles and is 
still here today. When we began this journey most of us would have been happy 
for the network to survive one year, now we are confidently looking forward to 
our fourth year and hopefully many more.

It has been quite a journey and we can't wait to see what the future holds. 
From all the staff at PonyChat we thank you for sharing this journey with us, 
for sharing your good times and your bad, for showing us the pinnacle of talent 
and the depth of your friendship. We would not be here today if not for all of 
you.
