PonyChat offers its users a hosted connection bouncer (BNC) for people that 
want to stay connected even if their computer is not. As of the time of this 
article being written, the BNC is in a beta state, meaning that users need to 
be whitelisted to use it.

Terms of the BNC
----------------

- Do not use the BNC to evade channel bans
- Do not use the BNC to violate any network rules

Becoming Whitelisted
--------------------

Go into [`#bnc`](/webchat?autojoin=bnc) and ask for access to the BNC. A staff 
member will add you to the list and refer you to the
[signup page](https://bnc-signup.ponychat.net) to finish the setup.

Usage
-----

1. Open [the web interface](https://bnc.ponychat.net) from a computer or mobile 
   device.
2. Sign in using your NickServ username and password.
3. Enjoy chatting!
