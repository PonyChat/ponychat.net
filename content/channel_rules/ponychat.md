- Please read and follow the [network rules](/network-rules/) as these rules 
build on top of them.
- Please keep all topics of conversation and links at 
a [PG](http://www.ign.com/wikis/content-ratings/MPAA) level.
- Don't harass or flame users.
- The rules are not complete or exhaustive. They define a spirit of the kind of 
behavior we want to see in #ponychat, not a series of writs declaring what can 
and cannot happen.

If you have a problem, please feel free to tell a channel operator in PM.

## Spoiler Policy

The spoiler policy is that anything that has been aired on TV or otherwise 
announced by Hasbro or other upstream sources is fair game. This includes 
talking about the episodes as they are airing.
