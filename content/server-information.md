## IPv6 Support

All of our round robins and DNS entries will have IPv6 addresses added and most
clients should select them automatically. If for some reason your IPv6 stack
has issues, please connect to `irc.ipv4.ponychat.net` instead of
`irc.ponychat.net`.

## BNC

PonyChat offers a bnc server `bnc.ponychat.net` using ZNC. For more
information, see [here](/help/bnc).
